#Scripts for an easy life

A few bash shells scripts I use to make life easier. Add this repository to your PATH for easy access.

##mkproject

<code>
    mkproject [project-name]
</code>

Creates and populates the relavent files to get started on a new static web project. Includes:
- index.html
- css directory and template
- js directory and template
- All files linked from index



##server

<code>
    server
</code>

Initializes a python simple server in the current directory. Its just one python command, but it always slips my mind.
