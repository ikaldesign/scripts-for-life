Scripts for an easy life
==========

A few bash shells scripts I use to make life easier. Add this repository to your PATH for easy access.

##mkproject
Creates and populates the relavent files to get started on a new static web project. Includes:
- index.html
- css directory and template
- js directory and template
- All files linked from index


##server
Initializes a python simple server in the current directory. Its just one command, but it always slips my mind.
